Enables configuration of all installed "foxMod" module settings after userconfig folder is copied to Arma 3 install directory, via editing "<Arma 3 install dir>\userconfig\foxConfig\settings.hpp" with any text editor.

This is only required if you wish to configure any of the options provided in the other "foxMod" modules.

To use, first navigate to your mod directory (Launcher -> Mods -> Right-Click "foxMod Configuration" -> "Open folder")
Then, simply copy the "userconfig" folder to your Arma 3 install directory.
	e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3"

Once copied, simply edit the "<Arma 3 install dir>\userconfig\foxConfig\settings.hpp" file in any text editor as desired.
More information on each option can be found within the file itself.

Public server key is included in the "keys" folder.
This mod is client-side, and has no effect when run directly on a dedicated server.
