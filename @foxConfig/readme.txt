This folder contains optional files to configure options for any of my installed modules.

To use, simply copy the "userconfig" folder to your Arma 3 install directory.
	e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3"

Once copied, simply edit the "\userconfig\foxConfig\settings.hpp" file in any text editor as desired.
More information on each option can be found within the file itself.

If you wish to use the default options, you can ignore (or delete) this directory.

Enjoy!
